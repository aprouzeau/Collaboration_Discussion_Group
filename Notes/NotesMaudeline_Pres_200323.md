**Transtitional Interfaces (TI)** : croiser des interfaces (réalité, AR et VR).

**Reality-virtuality continuum (RVC)** : “switching between displays, input/output modalities, representation of data or functionnality according to their preferences

Bringe the gap between :  
    - interacting with objects and computers (PC + touch screen)  
    - interacting inside of AR & VR ( head-mounted displays)

Cross reality & cross virtuality interfaces.

**Objectives** : importance of collaboration + maintaining awareness and coherence in transitions in differents locations.

**No design guidelines. No best practices for designing collaboration TIs.** No method to analyse. Not enought data.

2 contributions :  
     1.  TI prototype + study design on transition collaboration. Strategies of participants, perception of collaboration.  
     2.  4 lenses for collaboration :          
                   - place & distance  
                   - temporal patterns  
                   - group use of context  
                   - individual use of context

TI since 2001.  
**”Context”** : environment in which users collaborate and interact. Define by its position on RVC & by properties (scale, representation, navigation mode).  
Co-context : same context but not see each other inreal but see each other in virtual proximal embodiments // Cross-context : separate by diffferent context visible with virtual distal embodiments.

***XR Interfaces*** *: systems that enable a smooth transition and/or collaboration of users between different degrees of virtuality.*

Computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW)

1. Provide sufficient workspace awareness :  verbal communication, & shared audio territories (crucial for hybrid collaboration)
    
2. natural communication : gaze & gesture
    
3. Goal of collaboration : dividing it into phases of mixed-focus collaboration with more tightly-coupled or loosely-coupled collaboration style

# Study : emergent participant behaviors and collaborative activities of 15 dyads

Recorded, tracked, and logged rich data from different sources such as audio/video/screen recordings, virtual and physical positions of active devices and users, application logs, and the state of the virtual workspace.

**Goal** :  
    - observe user behavior during a demanding collaborative activity  
    - identify recurring patterns and typical characteristics of the transitional collaboration that would unfold.

Observations to  
    1. identify characteristic commonalities and differences between the observed collaborations (differences in patterns, spatial distribution, preferences)  
   2. derive and propose analytical lenses : method contribution + tools

Il n’est pas possible de faire des généralités car ça dépend de plusieurs facteurs. Leur objectif est d’observer une quantité de comportements.

**Goal** : provoke and observe an ideally wide enough range of behaviors, usage patterns, and different forms of collaboration in TIs to derive and propose new analytical methods and visualization techniques (i.e., our "analytical lenses") that can capture the characteristic commonalities and diferences in dyadic collaboration in TIs and can be applied for their detailed analysis in future studies.

# Task

Collaborative spatial optimization problem.

Objectives for participants to design the illumination of a fctitious, urban park which have various winding paths, diferent plazas.  
Participants could place a limited number of street lamps inside the park and adjust each lamp’s luminance level.

They could discover these animals when walking through to navigate the park --> increased the spatial complexity of the collaboration and thus also the suitability of TIs for the task.

Time limit pour les patterns d’usage, les comportements et la tâche de performance globale.

# Prototype

**Context “Reality”** : PC + screen. Minimap of the park + location of other + score, barcharts, figures + pins

**Context “Augmented Reality”** : hologram of the park + tablet to interact. Navigation rapprocher la tablette pour zoom et se déplacer pour se déplacer. Add lamps with gaze cursor and touch button on the tablet.

**Context ‘Virtual Reality“** : VR visualization of the park at night. First-person experience. Teleportation + actual walking. Adjust brightness. See nocturne animals.

\--> distribution of information and functionalities chosen to motivate participants to use transitions between diff context and observe collaborative and transitional behavior.

\--> Awareness clue :  
    - where : each participant see the location of other and their context  
    - what : edited or brushed artifacts are highlighted. Team’s latest actions  
    - who: no need with two participants but color to differentiate their actions              

Talk and listen natural but no collaborative activities.

# Data  

## Data Collection

Goals :  
    - pattern of behavior  
    - collaborative usage of context,  
    - spatial distribution in the virtual space,  
    - strategies for creating awareness.

Qualitative Data :  
    - 3 cameras + microphone + screen streamed --> centralized  
    - write for interview

Quantitative Data :  
    - participant position in virtual park  
    - current context  
    - scores  
    - events (mark location, changing context, placing lamps, change brightness  
    - post-study questionnaire (individual work + workload as a team + workspace awarness + personal information

## Data Validation

Seuil de validation : 75 000 : collaborative practices were meaningful enough.

Correlation between score and number of transition --> benefices of the prototype.

Questionnaire : mental demand & effort élevés --> work on design, animated transition and participants need to familirized.  
Physical and temporal demand low --> not perceived particularity cumbersome and demanding by individual users.

Team WorkLoad Questionnary (TWLQ) :  
   1. task workload  
   2. team workload : demand of team interactions  
   3. task-team balancing : management of taskwork

High demand for team collaboration, especially communication & coordination demand.  
Intense verbal communication.  
Teamwork --> substantial load on participant

Establish sufficient group awareness for meaningful and successful collaboration  
Verbal communication --> create awareness & exchange information (intention, actions, goals, location)  
Use of markers or pins for other actions then expected

« Finding #1: Our results show that our study prototype and tasks afforded sufficiently complex, meaningful, and realistic collaboration in TIs. Participants collaborated successfully and reported sufficient group awareness. We also found that (1.) workspace awareness can be established in a TI, even in the absence of more sophisticated awareness cues, (2.) comparably simple designs of transitions and awareness cues can be sufficient but potentially increase mental demand, communication demand, and coordination demand, (3.) verbal communication plays a critical role and appears essential for transitional collaboration, (4.) in some cases, users’ arousal by and enjoyment of changing contexts could outweigh the physical and temporal demands of switching devices in TIs. » ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CWXK454U?page=9))

## Data Analysis

Two-step analysis :  
    1.  identified characteristic commonalities and differences in transitional collaboration between the dyads.    
             - experimenter’s log :behavior, patterns, themes of collaboration  
             - One observation = 1 stick note + 1 color = 1 category  
             - update each day  
             - result : 11 clusters and 4 chosen for step 2  
    2.  used different metrics and visualizations to quantitatively substantiate a selection of four of the observations from step 1.  
             - continuous discussion until consensus

# Result

## LENS #1 : Understanding Place and Distance in Transitional Collaboration

Mesure physical distance between participants.  
Physical + virtual distance & place

Co-context collaborative : stand close in the park, view artifacts together, work “tighly coupled”. --> greater virtual Euclidean distances and loosely-coupled collaboration.  
Cross-context : work “tighly coupled” (fortement couplé) --> smaller distance and tihgly collaboration.

Use matrices with context-specific histograms showing distributions of the virtual Euclidean distance d as analytical tools.

## LENS #2 : Temporal Patterns in Transitional Collaboration  

Pattern :  
    1. Phase of exploration (strategies, functionalities, responsibilities) : majority moved through contexts in parallel  
    2. Phase of coordinated work : different frequencies of transition and individual work

Figure 12 : small multiples [39] of a **context time-diagram** representing the usage of contexts over time of each.

Calcul of **frequency of transitions** / number of transition

## LENS #3 : Group Use of Contexts

1 stay in a context + 1 switch between 2 others contexts --> V + A/R to avoid time consiuption OR R + A/V to have a global view.

**Context triforce** for notation and formalization of context’s usage.  
Nodes = context combinations  
Edges = transitions / thickness= quantity percentage  
No difference between P1 & P2

Fast overview of preferred context combination, co-context VS cross-context collaboration and frequently used transitions

## LENS #4: Individual Use of Contexts

Two roles : one change and the other stay in a context -- interviews explained : individual preferences + gained expertise over time + avoid transition cost. Voluntary or not.  
Two change frequently.

Measure asymmetry : describe individual patterns.  
**Context tri force**  
Nodes = context

Compare the 2 graph of tri force example D3 and D10 or D5 and D12.

Participant influence each other’s usage patterns. Creation of asymmetry in time spending in context and in number of transitions.  
Need to consider individual behavior and group

# Limitations

Methodological contribution : LENS #1 to #4.  
Observational contributions

## Finding #1

Observations limited to this specific task and design of this prototype : verbal communication and enjoyment.  
Work on transitional collaboration in real-work tasks.

Limit with dyadic collaboration and three contexts

## Quantitative Analyse

Interpret differently the data.

## Qualitative Analyse

Calcul Euclidean distance is not necessarily linked to close collaboration.

Better to study co-located, remote and hybrid collaboration
