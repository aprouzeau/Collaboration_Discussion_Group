# Establishing Awareness through Pointing Gestures during Collaborative Decision-Making in a Wall-Display Environment

Sharing a physical environmeent = facilitates gaining awareness of others’ actions and intentions

This paper seeks to advance the current understanding on how users share awareness information in wall-display environments and focusses on mid-air pointing gestures as a foundational part of communication.

# Introduction

Large interactive displays

- enable large amounts of data to be presented in different scales and views
    
- support users to better identify details and gain more insights about the data
    
- cognitive and perceptual benefits
    
- enhance user performance and satisfaction for such tasks
    
- multiple users can access and view content at the same time, and observe each other’s interactions.
    
- coordinate their activities, anticipate others’ actions, and assist each other.
    
- awareness information makes collaborators’ actions and intentions clear and allows them to seamlessly align and integrate their activities with those of other group members.
    

## Research question

how mid-air pointing gestures are used by groups of four collocated participants to share awareness information during collaborative decision-making in a wall-display environment ?

## Déroulement

First study awareness information during collocated collaborative use .  
And then use the insights gained to design awareness support for mixed-presence settings.

Wall-sized displays have three common applications :  
    - navigating a single, very large object (3D molecule)  
    - comparing a large quantity of related visual content (photos)  
    - juxta positioning data from diferent sources (compare)

Two most common types of awareness  
    - Situation awareness : the acquisition and interpretation of information from the environment that is fundamental for subsequent decision making  
    - Workspace awareness : monitoring the activity of others, which provides context for one’s activities. Where others are working, what they are doing, and what they are going to do next.  
    - **Awareness information** is crucial for coordinating actions, managing coupling, talking about the task, anticipating others’ actions, and finding opportunities to assist one another.  
              \* people’s bodies  
              \* workspace artefacts  
              \* conversation and gestures

The prototypical pointing gesture is a communicative body movement that projects a vector from a body part, with this vector indicating a certain direction, location, or object [23]

How mid-hair pointing gestures are used around wall-sized surfaces  
How they support the sharing of awareness information with the aim of investigating how they can be replicated remotely on another display.

# User study

24 persons (6 groups of 4).  
4 tasks.  
*Objectif* : analyse a broader set of behavioural pattern (analyser un ensemble plus large de modèles de comportement)  
*Question* : Which types of mid-air pointing gestures are made by groups during collaborative work in a wall-display environment and how do they contribute to awareness information?  
*Data* : audio-visual - qualitaitive approach - type and frequencies of users’ pointing gestures.

# The decision-making scenario

That aimed at creating a control tower for experts and decision-makers to help managing medical supply chains during distress times.  
Scenario adapted :  
   - show different types of data  
   - integrate collaborative mechanisms  
   - be solvable by non-experts  

*Task* : estimate and select equipment --> interpret, analyze and identify the best solution.  
    + mechanism of collaboration : each participant has a resource

# Participants

Questioannaire :  
    - familiarity with teammates.  
    - asked about the frequency of their usage of large interactive displays  
    -  how often they use similar pointing devices

# Participants

360° immersive arena, 2m high, composed of 12 screens. Circle of 3.64m diameter. Eight of the screens were used as surfaces for the study.

The experimenter (part of the research team) gave the participants an introduction to the scenario, together with general instructions on how to proceed through the tasks.

# Data

Audio-visual recordings of the study. Analyse manually.  
The decision-making process using three fxed cameras (top, front, and back cameras).  
Annotate properly the gesture performance. 2 rounds : subtype and duration PUIS referent and target

# Results

Created a gesture typology :  
    - Narrative pointing (NP) : points sharply with the index fnger or moves the fnger towards a larger area of the display. Speechaccompanied (read or explian). Longest duration.  
    - Loose pointing (LP) : user is not looking at the screen and holds the hand usually open (3d) or palm up. Vague communicative goals, are usually not speech-accompanied and are of very small duration  
    - Sharp pointing (SP) : “stereotypical” pointing gesture with an index fnger where a user points to a very specifc area of the display

NP != SP (Narratif n’est pas une succession de SP car c’est continu)

\==> Differences : differed with regard to hand/palm usage, referent, target and duration

Excluded in our results touch-pointing gestures

LP is most frequent. Not necessarily for showing a specific area.  
**Why ?** Larger distance to the screen and the scaling up of the data, users might perceive approximative pointing as sufcient and do not need to point at a specifc area.

# Discussion

**Objectif** : observe the most relevant non-verbal cues to consider when designing awareness support for remote collaboration. (observer les indices non verbaux les plus pertinents à prendre en compte lors de la conception d'un support de sensibilisation à la collaboration à distance.)

Three types pointing gestures play an important role for establishing awareness during collocated decision-making at wall displays.

The visualisation of narrative pointing can be less precise than sharp pointing but should be shown for a longer duration to accompany the fow of the narration.

# Conclusion & future work

- Co-speech gestures are a very intuitive and expressive means of communication and therefore play a crucial role in collaborative decision-making.
    
- Investigated mid-air pointing gestures and their subtypes based on their communicative function as awareness cues.
    
- The loose pointing was most frequently used, followed by sharp pointing and narrative pointing.
    
- The reliance on gesture subtypes varied across participants and groups.
    
- Sometimes vague pointing was sufcient to support verbal negotiations.
    
- Other gestures have not been studied here.
